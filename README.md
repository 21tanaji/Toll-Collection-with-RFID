# Toll-Collection-system
This project using Arduino as microprocessor. Toll collections from vehicles to pass any streets, highways and bridges must be fast and digitalized. In order to fast movement and transport, computerized and automated system is necessary. That is why implementing the digitalization in toll system is the main motive and objective of this project.
In this project, as achieving fast transport is the main goal, there will be maintained a two-lane system for the vehicles. And the lane that has comparatively small number of vehicles will be displayed so that drivers can take decision and choose the faster lane.
